# 🎵 Music Streaming Behavior Analysis 
## 📌 Project Summary

This bootcamp project explores user listening habits on a music streaming platform using real-world data. By comparing activity patterns between two cities—**Springfield** and **Shelbyville**—we aim to uncover behavioral insights that can inform marketing and product decisions.

The project focuses on three main phases: **data exploration**, **preprocessing**, and **analytical comparison**.

---

## 🧠 Objectives

- Describe the dataset structure and contents.
- Clean the data: rename columns, remove duplicates, and handle missing values.
- Analyze user activity by **day of the week** and **city** to detect trends or differences in listening behavior.
